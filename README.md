# Computer Vision Lab II - Image Processing Exercises

## Overview

This repository contains a series of laboratory exercises focused on various image processing tasks using Octave. Each exercise is designed to help understand and implement different image processing techniques. The tasks range from basic image import and display to more advanced topics like interpolation, image rotation, and image enhancement.

## Prerequisites

- [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/)
- Basic knowledge of image processing concepts

## Installation

1. **Install Octave**:
    - Download and install Octave from the [official website](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/computer-vision-lab-ii.git
    cd computer-vision-lab-ii
    ```

## Exercises

1. **Image Import and Display**:
    - Function to import multiple images in different formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP) from a specified directory.
    - Display each image using different colormaps (e.g., grayscale, hot, jet).

2. **Image Resizing**:
    - Script to resize an image to specified dimensions while maintaining aspect ratio.
    - Compare the resized image to the original in terms of quality and resolution.

3. **Grayscale Conversion**:
    - Implement different methods of grayscale conversion (average, luminosity, desaturation).
    - Display and compare the results of grayscale conversion.

4. **Image Cropping**:
    - Function to crop an image to a specific region of interest using input coordinates.

5. **Interpolation Techniques**:
    - Implement and compare different interpolation techniques (nearest neighbor, bilinear, bicubic) for resizing images.

6. **Image Rotation**:
    - Function to rotate an image by a specified angle, handling changes in image size and aspect ratio.

7. **Image Download**:
    - Script to download images from a specified URL and save them locally.
    - Handle different image formats and sources.

8. **Image Capture from Camera**:
    - Function to capture images from a connected camera device with adjustable parameters like brightness and contrast.

9. **Color Space Conversion**:
    - Function to load images with different color spaces (e.g., RGB, CMYK) and display them.
    - Compare how different color spaces affect image appearance and processing.

10. **Image Metadata Extraction**:
    - Script to extract and display metadata from an image (creation date, resolution, color space).

11. **Pixel Value Adjustment**:
    - Function to adjust pixel values of an image using mathematical operations (scaling, translation).

12. **Resolution Analysis**:
    - Compare images of different resolutions and analyze how resolution affects image processing tasks.

13. **Color Space Conversion for Image Processing**:
    - Convert images to different color spaces (e.g., grayscale, HSV) and observe the effects on tasks like edge detection and segmentation.

14. **Image Enhancement Techniques**:
    - Implement and apply image enhancement techniques (histogram equalization, contrast stretching) to a sample image.

## Usage

Each exercise is self-contained with its own script or function. Follow the instructions provided in the comments within each script to understand how to run and test the functions.
